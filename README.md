8. Now go to ``` site_config/ ``` and change the info in ``` database*.txt ``` to match the details.
<br>
Normally, All you need to do is change ``` databasename.txt ```
<br>
Once all done, Go to http://localhost/signup/ and create your account.

Now once you have made your account, Go to ``` site_config/admin_email.txt ``` and set it to the email you used to sign up.

That should give you access to the admin panel. If you want to change the header buttons, Go to ``` site_config/headerbuttons.txt and change the html ```
